# nHentai Sauce Viewer
A simple app to view those juicy hentai sauces. :)

## What does it do?
If you ever browsed a website like Reddit, you probabily found a nice picture and wanted to know where it is from. You go to the comments and find a 6-digit (or less) number and don't know what to do with it. With this program, you can paste that code in the 'Sauce ID' field, select the browser of your choice, then click 'View sauce' and enjoy reading a nice hentai.

## Features
- Bookmarks: If you find a hentai that you want to save for later, you can simply click 'Save', and later highlight it and click 'Open' to view it.
- Incognito: When using the app, whatever browser you choose will be launched in incognito, but if you're brave enough, you can uncheck 'Incognito' (enabled by default) and your browser will be launched normally.
- Roulette: Don't know what to read? Click the 'ROULETTE' button and a randomly selected hentai will be opened.
- No traces left behind: The program stores its bookmarks in a file called 'bookmarks.conf' which will be created in the same folder as the main executable. This means that you can put this program on a flash drive and open it on many different computers without leaving traces behind.
